# Telegrams

A simple resource for RedM which allows players to send and receive telegrams. 

# Installation 

This resource is dependant on the RedEM RP framework for authenticating moderators but can easily be configured to work as a standalone resource. You can download it here: https://github.com/RedEM-RP.

- Extract Atomic into your resources folder
- Start the Atomic resource in your server.cfg
- In-game, use the "delete" key to open Atomic

You can add new moderators by ammending the users group to "moderator" in the redemrp database. Edit line server of the server.lua file to manage which groups can access Atomic.
