# Telegrams

A simple resource for RedM which allows players to send and receive telegrams. 

# Installation 

This resource requires mysql-async to communicate with the database. You can download it here: https://github.com/amakuu/mysql-async-temporary/.

- Extract telegrams into your resources folder
- Import telegrams.sql into your database
- Start the telegrams resource in your server.cfg

You can add new locations where telegrams can be by amending the locations table in the client.lua file.
